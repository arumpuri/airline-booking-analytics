# airline-booking-analytics

## Overview
A comprehensive analysis of airline customer booking patterns using machine learning techniques. This project focuses on predicting booking completion and understanding the factors that influence customer booking decisions.

## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of booking patterns
- Feature engineering for time-based and behavioral attributes
- Random Forest classification model for booking prediction
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis for model interpretation
- Visualization of customer booking patterns and preferences

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn
- SHAP
- matplotlib

## Dataset
The analysis uses booking data including:
- Customer preferences (extra baggage, preferred seats, in-flight meals)
- Booking timing (purchase lead time, flight hour, day)
- Trip details (duration, route, origin)
- Customer choices (number of passengers, length of stay)
